# Virtual-Market-Margin-Tracker-OSRS-
A real-time arbitrage analysis engine for OSRS, calculating margins across 7,000+ recipes using the OSRS Wiki and Real-time Prices APIs

Features:
  Pulls the high and Low pricing of craftable items, and displays their profit margins
  Selecting an item within the list showcases the items and amount needed to craft the selected item
  Factors in the 2% GE tax, which is capped at 5m GP

Things I would like to add in the future:
  As items have buy limits (you can only buy X amount every 4 hours), the current state of the project takes into account the margins of crafting the item once. Would like to create a potential profit margin for each items buy limits
  Implement pages as it's all on one screen
  Filters for better user experience
